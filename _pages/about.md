I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering at _Indiana University Bloomington_. 
I earned my M.S. degree in Engineering from the _Xi'an Jiaotong University_ in 2023 and my B.S. degree in Engineering from _Xidian University_ in 2020. 
My research focus on the field of **quantum computing**, **quantum security**, and **computer vision**.
